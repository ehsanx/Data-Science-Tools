# Welcome to the **Data-Science-Tools** Guide

This book serves as a comprehensive resource for learning essential tools and techniques used in data science, **entirely written in Python**. Whether you are new to programming or an experienced data scientist looking to enhance your skills, this guide covers a wide range of topics, from foundational concepts to advanced data visualization techniques. Each module is carefully designed to build your proficiency in various tools and workflows that are crucial for effective data science projects.

## Table of Contents Overview

- **Module 0: Jupyter & Google Collab**  
  Get started with two of the most popular environments for running Python code: Jupyter notebooks and Google Colab. Learn how to set up your environment and run code interactively.

- **Module 1: VSCode**  
  Explore Visual Studio Code (VSCode), a powerful and lightweight code editor. This module will guide you through setting up VSCode for data science workflows, including useful extensions for Python and data analysis.

- **Module 2: Why Visualize Data?**  
  Understand the importance of data visualization and how it plays a crucial role in exploring and communicating data insights effectively.

- **Module 3: Visual Encoding Channels**  
  Learn about visual encoding channels—such as position, size, shape, and color—that form the building blocks for designing effective and insightful visualizations.

- **Module 4: Visualizing Distributions**  
  Dive into the art and science of visualizing distributions to understand patterns, variability, and trends in your data.

- **Module 5: Exploratory Data Analysis and 2D Categorical Distributions**  
  Master the techniques of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and learn how to visualize relationships between two categorical variables.

- **Module 6: Designing Plots for Communication**  
  Data visualization is not only about exploration; it's also about communication. This module will teach you how to design plots that communicate your findings clearly to various audiences.

- **Module 7: Chart Interactivity**  
  Add interactivity to your charts to engage users and allow them to explore the data on their own. Learn how to create interactive plots using tools like Plotly and Bokeh.

- **Module 8: File Names, Project Organization, Virtual Environments**  
  Effective project organization is critical for collaboration and scalability. This module covers best practices for naming files, organizing projects, and managing Python environments.

- **Module 9: Jupyter Book**  
  Learn how to create beautiful, publication-quality books and documentation from Jupyter notebooks using Jupyter Book.

- **Module 10: Git Using Github Desktop**  
  Version control is essential for collaborative data science projects. This module introduces Git and GitHub Desktop for managing changes and collaborating on code.

- **Module 11: Github Branches**  
  Understand how to use GitHub branches for managing different versions of your project, implementing features, and fixing bugs without affecting the main codebase.

- **Module 12: TableOne Package in Python**  
  Learn how to use the `TableOne` package in Python for generating summary tables that are commonly used in medical and clinical research.

- **Module 13: Exploring Date/Time Data with datetime**  
  Handling date and time data can be tricky. This module covers the essentials of working with date and time data using Python’s `datetime` module.

## How to Use This Guide

Each module is self-contained and can be followed in sequence or individually, depending on your current level of expertise and interest. You can jump directly to any module and start learning.

Whether you're aiming to sharpen your skills or deepen your understanding of data science tools, this guide provides valuable insights and practical examples, all using Python. We hope you find these resources helpful as you continue your journey in data science!
